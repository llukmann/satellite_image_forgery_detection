# satellite_image_forgery_detection
In this project, two experiments are being carried out to detect fakes on satellite images (images taken from open sources, in particular from Kaggle). The first experiment is based on the use of CBM, K nearest neighbors and Logistic regression. The effectiveness of the selected methods is investigated by comparing the quality metrics (accura—Åy, precision, recall, F1-score, Roc-AUC score) and the study of overfitting. The second experiment is based on the training of the classical CNN and DenseNet, the comparison takes place according to the same quality metrics.
